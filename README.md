# Assignment 22

The GC-content of a DNA string is given by the percentage of nucleobases in the string that are 'C' or 'G'. For example, the GC-content of "AGCTATAG" is 37.5% because 3 of the 8 nucleobases in the DNA string are 'C' or 'G' (3 / 8 = 0.375). 

Write a method that returns the GC-content percentage of a given DNA string.

### Sample Outputs

```
gcContent("CCACCCTCGTGGTATGGCTAGGCATTCA") -> 57.142857142857146%
```

```
gcContent("TAGCCAGAACCGTTTCTCTGA") -> 47.61904761904762%
```

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style.
